Welcome to Natural Language Processing  
It is one of the most exciting research areas as of today  
We will see how Python can be used to work with text files. 
Python possesses a variety of features that contribute to its widespread adoption and versatility:
Easy to Learn and Read:
Python's syntax is designed for readability and simplicity, often resembling natural language, which makes it easier for beginners to learn and for developers to understand existing code.
Interpreted Language:
Python code is executed line by line by an interpreter, facilitating rapid prototyping and easier debugging compared to compiled languages.
Dynamically Typed:
Python automatically infers the data type of variables at runtime, eliminating the need for explicit type declarations and speeding up development.
High-Level Language:
Python abstracts away low-level details like memory management, allowing developers to focus on problem-solving rather than system intricacies.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
Python fully supports OOP principles such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, enabling modular and reusable code.
Free and Open Source:
Python is freely available for use and distribution, and its source code is accessible to the public, fostering a collaborative development environment.
Large Standard Library:
Python comes with an extensive collection of built-in modules and packages, providing ready-to-use functionalities for various tasks, from web development to data manipulation.
Cross-Platform Compatibility:
Python code can run on different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.) without modification, promoting portability. 
Extensible and Embeddable:
Python can be extended with modules written in other languages (like C/C++) for performance-critical tasks, and it can also be embedded within other applications.
GUI Programming Support:
Python offers various libraries and frameworks (e.g., Tkinter, PyQt, Kivy) for developing graphical user interfaces.
Large Community Support:
Python boasts a vast and active global community of developers who contribute to its development, provide extensive documentation, and offer support through forums and online resources.
